            <h2>What is Bengkung Belly Binding?</h2>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <p>Bengkung belly binding is the art of wrapping a postpartum women's belly for physical support and to help hasten the recovery process after childbirth. 
                    This belly binding technique uses a long strip of cloth to wrap around the abdomen from the hips to the ribcage.</p>

                <p>Pregnancy hormones cause the tissue to stretch and thin so the belly can expand, and the growing uterus pushes the muscles apart. 
                As a result, the muscles may not fully come back together after pregnancy, causing a lingering belly bump. 
                It can also lead to other problems, such as back pain, poor posture, and a weak core.
                Belly binding can help to hold the muscles together and speed up that closure.</p>
