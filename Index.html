            <div class="content">
                
                <p>My name is Gloria. I was born and raised in Hong Kong and live my family in Utah. I have three kids at elementary ages, and they are my world. I love music and playing the piano for years. I am learning to manipulate the organ starting from the beginning of this year. Hopefully I could be able to be an organist at church by the end of the year. Leraning programming is challenging for me, but I love to learn new things, and it helps me to grow and maximize the use of my brain.</p>

                <p>Hong Kong is a special administrative region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. It comprises 200 islands located in Eastern Asia bordering the South China Sea and China. Much of Hong Kong's terrain is hilly to mountainous with steep slopes. The government system is a limited democracy; the chief of state is the president of China, and the head of government is the chief executive of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has a free market economy in which the prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system. Hong Kong is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).</p>
